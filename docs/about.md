# About pyRE

## Project Overview

pyRE (Python Reinsurance) is a comprehensive Python package designed to provide actuarial and statistical tools for non-life reinsurance pricing and analysis. The package aims to standardize and streamline common reinsurance pricing workflows, making them more accessible, reproducible, and efficient.

## Purpose and Goals

The primary goals of pyRE are:

1. **Standardization**: Provide a standardized framework for reinsurance pricing calculations
2. **Reproducibility**: Enable fully reproducible analyses with clear audit trails
3. **Efficiency**: Streamline common workflows to reduce manual effort
4. **Accessibility**: Make advanced actuarial methods accessible to a wider audience
5. **Extensibility**: Create a flexible architecture that can be extended for specific use cases

## Key Features

pyRE offers a wide range of features organized into several modules:

- **Claims Analysis**: Tools for managing and analyzing claims data
- **Exposure Management**: Classes for handling exposure data
- **Treaty Modeling**: Functionality for modeling reinsurance contracts
- **Experience Rating**: Methods for analyzing historical experience
- **Exposure Rating**: Tools for exposure-based rating
- **Rate Monitoring**: Utilities for tracking rate changes and adequacy

## Development Philosophy

pyRE is developed with the following principles in mind:

- **Modularity**: Components are designed to be modular and reusable
- **Transparency**: Algorithms and methodologies are clearly documented
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
- **Performance**: Critical operations are optimized for performance
- **Usability**: User-friendly interfaces and clear documentation
